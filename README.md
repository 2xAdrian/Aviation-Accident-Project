# Aviation Accident Project
## Phase 1 Project Overview
 The Aviation Accident project involves venturing into the Aviation industry to understand the risks associated with different aircraft to make informed purchasing decisions. 

### Interactive Dashboard Link:
##### Below is the link to my Tableau which will show the different factors that would cause accidents.

## Buisness Understanding
### There are certain questions you might have, what am I getting myself into? Let us take a deep dive in understanding what you don't know you're missing.
 * Which aircraft types have the lowest risk of accidents?
 * What factors contribute to aviation accidents?
 * How can we minimize risks when purchasing and operating new aircraft?

## Data

#### Aviation Accident database is collected from:
  * kaggle website by Kheirallah Samaha
  * https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses?resource=download

#### What are we looking for?
  * Aircraft Type
  * Weather
  * Location
  * Injuries

#### Data Visualization
  * Top Accidents by Aircraft Make and Model

## Conclusion
#### There are many factors that are interlapped with your decision to purchase operating airplanes for commerical and private enterprises. More importantly, there are always risk that you must look into when deciding the perfect aircraft for you. In my findings, you can see that when purchasing an Aircraft there are specifics to the Aircraft itself that will cause you to choose one on a specific Brand or even Engine type. Reciprocating motors are the main engine type that will cause accidents according to my findings. At the end of the day it dives down to who the pilot is. In my findings, the most common variable that would be the root cause of the issue is the Pilot itself. As time goes on, we will have better engines, more safety precautions, and less possibilites for accidents to occur.
